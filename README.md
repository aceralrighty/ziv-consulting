# Quint Portfolio Site

Welcome to my Quaint Portfolio Site! 👋

This website serves as a showcase for my projects as I embark on my journey as a software engineer. My goal is to provide potential employers and clients with insight into what I'm capable of.

## Explore My Work
Feel free to browse through my projects and see what I’ve been working on. Each project reflects my dedication to building and refining my skills in software development.

## Get in Touch
If you have any inquiries, feedback, or just want to test out the functionality, there's a form at the bottom of my page at [ziv-consulting.dev](https://ziv-consulting.dev). Be my guest and check it out!

May your day be fruitful, and enjoy! 🚀
