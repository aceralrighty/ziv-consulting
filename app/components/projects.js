        description: "This is a comprehensive .NET 9.0 learning project built as a modular monolith with 8 independent modules (Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Recommendation, StockPrediction, and Metrics), each having its own DbContext, repositories, and services. The standout feature is an advanced ML.NET stock prediction system that processes 619,040 records with 97.78% RÂ² accuracy and 2.5% average prediction error, alongside a complete monitoring stack using Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry. The architecture emphasizes enterprise-level patterns including generic repositories, comprehensive caching, extensive testing, and real-time metrics tracking across all modules. It's designed to demonstrate modern .NET development practices while providing a foundation for eventual microservices migration.",
