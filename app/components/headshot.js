                    As an emerging software engineer with a solid technical foundation and growing interest in
                    leadership. I am excited to build my career in the technology industry with a long-term goal of
                    taking on management responsibilities. My recent internship at Cambridge Investment Research offered
                    valuable insights into the intersection of finance and technology, strengthening my belief in my
                    ability to contribute meaningfully to future employers' success.

                    During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on a fully functional payment processing portal
                    that clients could use for transactions. This hands-on experience not only sharpened my technical
                    skills but also gave me a glimpse into the importance of developing soft skills, such as:

                    This internship deepened my appreciation for how technology is transforming the financial industry,
                    and I am excited to continue developing my skills in both technical and leadership areas, so I can
                    contribute to the growth and innovation of organizations in the future.
